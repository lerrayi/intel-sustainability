   <h3 class="leader-quote">"If someone like me can make a small difference on one product that is going out with millions of units, what an impact we can have.</h2>
   <p class="leader-info">Michelle Chuaprasert used to lecture her daughters on being activists and helping the environment.
    Throughout her career, however, she struggled to see a connection between her own work and the advice she was giving.
    Wanting to change this, she went in an entirely new direction for her career. 
    As Intel's Senior Director of Innovation and Sustainability, she's now leading company-wide efforts to reduce Intel's carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices across its operations.</p>
   </p>
   <p class="leader-info">Michelle's story is not the only one of its kind.
    By supporting intel, you support a global team of innovators who are striving to stop climate change
    in even the smallest business units.
