# 🌿 Intel's Sustainability Journey
This is a website I built in a class collaboration with Intel in which we were instructed to make a demonstration of Intel's sustainability journey. This is the first website I've built after fully understanding the concept of *responsive* or *mobile-first* design. This is also my first work in corporate writing and marketing.

✨ Features:

∙🌍 An interactive timeline with horizontal snap scrolling on desktop and vertical scrolling on mobile

∙🧭 A responsive navbar that changes into a dropdown on smaller devices

∙📢 Intel reseach and marketing written by yours truly!
