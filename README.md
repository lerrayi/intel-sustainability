# 🌿 Intel's Sustainability Journey
This is a website I built in a class collaboration with Intel in which we were instructed to make a demonstration of Intel's sustainability journey. This is the first website I've built after fully understanding the concept of *responsive* or *mobile-first* design. This is also my first work in corporate writing and marketing, as I did a lot of my own research to enhance this project. Here's a list of things I implemented in this website:

## 📱 Responsiveness:

∙ An interactive timeline with horizontal snap scrolling on desktop and vertical scrolling on mobile

∙ A responsive navbar that changes into a dropdown on smaller devices

## 🤝 Accessibility:

∙ Colorblind-tested with help from [Toptal's colorblind filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter)

∙ High-contrast colors for low vision

∙ Fully keyboard navigable with added arrow navigation on milestones

∙ Proper semantic organization for screen readers

∙ Alt text on all images

## 🗺️ Localization:

∙ Detects if browser is using a right-to-left language

∙ Automatically enables RTL support (website reorganization) for right-to-left languages

## 💡 Bootstrap:

∙ Modal classes used for privacy notice popup
∙ Form classes used for newsletter subscription
