# 🌿 Intel's Sustainability Journey
This is a website I built in a class collaboration with Intel in which we were instructed to make a demonstration of Intel's sustainability journey. This is the first website I've built after fully understanding the concept of *responsive* or *mobile-first* design. This is also my first work in corporate writing and marketing.

## ✨ Features:

∙🌍 An interactive timeline with horizontal snap scrolling on desktop and vertical scrolling on mobile

∙🧭 A responsive navbar that changes into a dropdown on smaller devices

∙📢 Intel research and marketing written by yours truly!

## ♿ Accessibility (received an accessibility score of 100 on Lighthouse!):

∙✔️ Colorblind-tested with help from [Toptal's colorblind filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter)

∙🌗 High-contrast colors for low vision

∙⌨️ Fully keyboard navigable with added arrow navigation on milestones

∙📚 Proper semantic organization for screen readers

∙🏞️ Alt text on all images
