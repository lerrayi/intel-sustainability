# Intel's Sustainability Journey
This is a website I built in a class collaboration with Intel in which we were instructed to make a responsive demonstration of Intel's sustainability journey. This is the first website I've built after fully understanding the concept of responsive or mobile-first design. The main attraction is a sustainability initiatives timeline that uses horizontal snap scrolling on desktop and vertical scrolling on mobile. I also played around with a responsive navbar that changes into a dropdown on smaller devices.
