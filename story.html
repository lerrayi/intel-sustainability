          <b>Michelle Chuaprasert</b> used to lecture her daughters on being activists and helping the environment.
          Throughout her career, however, she struggled to see a connection between her own work and the advice she was giving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wanting to change this, she went in an entirely new direction for her career. 
          As Intel's Senior Director of Innovation and Sustainability, she's now leading company-wide efforts to 
          reduce Intel's carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices across its operations.
        </p>
        <h2 id="story-highlight">
          Michelle's story is not the only one of its kind.
        </h3>
